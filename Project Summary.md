Project Summary:
Designed a flood monitoring system using ESP32, integrating DHT22 (temp/humidity) and HC-SR04 (water level) sensors for real-time environmental data collection.
Enabled cloud connectivity via Wi-Fi, sending sensor data every 30 seconds for remote monitoring and real-time graph plotting using Blynk.
Developed interactive web and mobile dashboards on Blynk to visualize live sensor data and trends.
